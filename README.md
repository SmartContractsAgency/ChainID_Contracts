# How - it - works
All of us use certificates to showcase our achievements and capabilities. Certificates tell the world about our academic credentials, professional memberships and technical skills. They open doors of opportunities for us. But the way certificates are stored and managed today is archaic. Most of the certificates are either paper-based or stored in central databases of certifying authorities. 

This makes them easy to be faked and difficult to share with others in the digital world. They are a relic of the analog world. With ChainID we envisage a blockchain based platform which solves the current problems with certificate management and sharing. ChainID is a way to store credentials and certificates in a fraud-free and intuitive way using blockchain technology. 

Although blockchain can be used to keep official documents, this possibility is currently under-explored. We at Chain ID create a blockchain based platform to issue, keep and present any type of official document for verification. 

The common feature of such documents is that they contain very small amounts of text, but every word on such document has a great value. Another feature of these documents is that certain individuals have huge incentives to fake them. Combination of these factors (small text size, great value, and the need to protect from falsification) make such documents an ideal object to store in blockchain.
